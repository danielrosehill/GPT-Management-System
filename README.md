# GPT Management System

## Keywords

- LLMs
- GPTs
- Custom GPTs
- NocoDB

## Repository Description

The purpose of this GPT is to provide documentation which I will update periodically documenting a system I am creating using NocoDB for organizing and storing the output of ChatGPT prompts. The system is a work in progress but also currently includes the ability to store prompts (AKA a "prompt library") and includes other taxonomies to help organize data. The system leverages the usefulness of the underlying relational database in order to help the user make logical connections between custom GPTs, prompts used, and prompt outputs stored from generations.

## Repository Components

`System.md`
- High level document describing the system
