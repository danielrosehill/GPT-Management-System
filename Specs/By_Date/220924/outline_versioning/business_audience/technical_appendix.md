## 1. System Architecture

Output Hub utilizes a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. Key components include:

- **API Gateway**: Handles request routing, composition, and protocol translation
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Prompt Management Service**: Handles storage and retrieval of prompts
- **Output Processing Service**: Processes and stores LLM outputs
- **Analytics Service**: Performs data analysis and generates insights
- **Notification Service**: Manages alerts and notifications
- **Data Storage Layer**: Includes both relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases

## 2. Database Design

Our PostgreSQL database is optimized for efficient data management and quick retrieval. Key tables include:

- `users`: Stores user information and authentication details
- `organizations`: Manages organization-level data
- `customgpt`: Information about custom GPT models
- `promptlibrary`: A library of prompts
- `promptoutput`: Outputs from LLM interactions
- `knowledge_types`: Categorization for outputs
- `tags`: For flexible labeling of prompts and outputs
- `accuracy_levels`: Tracks perceived accuracy of outputs
- `development_stages`: Tracks the evolution of prompts

## 3. Data Relationships

Output Hub's database design incorporates various relationship types to enable complex data analysis and flexible organization:

### Many-to-Many (M2M) Relationships
- Custom GPTs and Agent Groups
- Prompt Outputs and Knowledge Types
- Prompt Library and Project Tags

### Many-to-One (M2O) Relationships
- Custom GPTs and GPT Models
- Prompt Outputs and Accuracy Levels
- Prompt Library and Prompt Development Stages

## 4. Scalability and Performance

- **Horizontal Scaling**: All services are designed for horizontal scaling to handle increased load
- **Caching Layer**: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx is employed for efficient load distribution
- **Database Optimization**: Includes indexing, partitioning, and query optimization
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs for time-consuming tasks (e.g., large-scale analytics)

## 5. Security and Compliance

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenancy with strict data segregation
- **Compliance Features**: Tools to assist with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements

## 6. Integration Capabilities

- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API for third-party integrations
- **Webhook Support**: For real-time data updates and workflow automation
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Support for SAML and OAuth2 for enterprise identity management
- **Data Import/Export**: Bulk data operations with support for various formats (CSV, JSON, XML)

## 7. Technical Requirements

### Deployment Options
- **Cloud-based**: Hosted on AWS, with options for Azure and Google Cloud
- **On-premises**: Deployable on customer's infrastructure with Docker and Kubernetes

### Client Requirements
- **Web Application**: Compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Access**: Responsive design for tablet and smartphone access

### Server Requirements (for on-premises deployment)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later
- **CPU**: Minimum 8 cores, recommended 16+ cores
- **RAM**: Minimum 32GB, recommended 64GB+
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 500GB, scalable based on data volume
