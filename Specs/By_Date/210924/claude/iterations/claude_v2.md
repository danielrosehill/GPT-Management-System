# Output Hub System Specification and Vision

## 1. Introduction

Output Hub is an advanced system designed to capture, organize, manage, and analyze interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Claude. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge management platform for both professional and personal use, focusing on complex prompts, detailed outputs, and the relationships between them.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purposes of Output Hub are:

1. To develop a well-organized, growing knowledge base of LLM interactions.
2. To provide a foundation for refining raw LLM outputs through human intervention.
3. To establish data relationships that enable iterative improvements in prompt engineering.
4. To facilitate advanced analysis of LLM interactions for improved productivity and insights.

### 1.2 Vision

Output Hub aims to become the central nexus for LLM interaction management, enabling users to:

- Build a personal or organizational "second brain" of AI-assisted knowledge.
- Continuously improve their prompt engineering skills through data-driven insights.
- Collaborate on and share effective prompts and refined outputs.
- Gain deep insights into their LLM usage patterns and effectiveness.

## 2. System Architecture

   - `content` (TEXT)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `user_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `users`)
   - `category_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `categories`)

2. `outputs`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `prompt_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `prompts`)
   - `model_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `llm_models`)
   - `original_content` (TEXT)
   - `edited_content` (TEXT)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

3. `gpt_agents`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `description` (TEXT)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

4. `users`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `username` (VARCHAR)
   - `email` (VARCHAR)
   - `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

#### 2.1.2 Lookup Tables

5. `llm_models`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `version` (VARCHAR)
   - `provider` (VARCHAR)

6. `tags`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)

7. `categories`
   - `id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `parent_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `categories`, for hierarchical categories)

#### 2.1.3 Junction Tables

8. `output_tags`
   - `output_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `outputs`)
   - `tag_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `tags`)
   - PRIMARY KEY (`output_id`, `tag_id`)

9. `prompt_tags`
   - `prompt_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `prompts`)
   - `tag_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `tags`)
   - PRIMARY KEY (`prompt_id`, `tag_id`)

10. `output_gpt_agents`
    - `output_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `outputs`)
    - `gpt_agent_id` (FOREIGN KEY to `gpt_agents`)
    - PRIMARY KEY (`output_id`, `gpt_agent_id`)

### 2.2 Key Relationships

- Prompts to Outputs: One-to-Many (A prompt can have multiple outputs)
- Outputs to LLM Models: Many-to-One (Many outputs can be from one model)
- Outputs to Tags: Many-to-Many (via `output_tags`)
- Prompts to Tags: Many-to-Many (via `prompt_tags`)
- Outputs to GPT Agents: Many-to-Many (via `output_gpt_agents`)
- Prompts to Categories: Many-to-One (A prompt belongs to one category)
- Categories to Categories: Self-referential for hierarchical categorization
