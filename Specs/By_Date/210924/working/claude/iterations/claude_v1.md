# Output Hub System Specification

## 1. Introduction

Output Hub is a comprehensive system designed to capture, organize, and manage daily interactions with GPT systems, including ChatGPT and Claude. The system serves both professional and personal needs, with a focus on complex prompts and detailed outputs.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purposes of Output Hub are:

1. To develop a well-organized, growing knowledge base of GPT interactions.
2. To provide a foundation for refining raw LLM outputs through human intervention.
3. To establish data relationships that enable iterative improvements in prompt engineering.

### 1.2 Scope

The system encompasses:
- Data capture from various GPT interactions
- Storage and organization of prompts and outputs
- Tagging and categorization of data
- User interfaces for data management and analysis

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Database Design

The core of Output Hub is a PostgreSQL database with the following key components:

#### 2.1.1 Main Tables

- Prompts: Stores user-generated prompts
- Outputs: Captures GPT-generated responses
- GPT Agents: Records information about custom GPTs used

#### 2.1.2 Lookup Tables

- LLM Models: Stores information about different language models
- Tags: Contains categories for classifying prompts and outputs

#### 2.1.3 Key Relationships

- Prompts to Outputs: Many-to-One (M2O)
- Outputs to LLM Models: Many-to-One (M2O)
- Outputs to Tags: Many-to-Many (M2M)

### 2.2 Data Fields

#### 2.2.1 Outputs Table

- output_text: Original GPT-generated text
- output_edited: Field for human-refined versions of the output

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Data Capture

- Ability to input and store complex prompts
- Automatic or manual capture of GPT-generated outputs
- Association of outputs with corresponding prompts

### 3.2 Data Management

- CRUD operations for all main tables
- Tagging system for categorizing prompts and outputs
- Versioning or history tracking for edited outputs

### 3.3 Analysis and Improvement

- Tools for analyzing the effectiveness of prompts based on outputs
- Features to support iterative prompt improvement
- Functionality to compare outputs across different LLM models

## 4. User Interfaces

### 4.1 Web-based UI

#### 4.1.1 CRUD Operations Interface

- Forms for entering new prompts and outputs
- Editing interface for refining existing outputs
- Delete functionality for removing unhelpful or irrelevant data

#### 4.1.2 Prompt Library Management

- Interface for organizing and categorizing prompts
- Tools for marking and tracking QA activities on prompts

#### 4.1.3 Relationship Management

- UI components for establishing and editing data relationships
- Visualization of relationships between prompts, outputs, and tags

### 4.2 User Experience Requirements

- Intuitive navigation between related data points
- Easy-to-use interfaces for configuring and editing related data
- Responsive design for accessibility across devices

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

- Efficient querying and retrieval of related data
- Scalability to handle growing volumes of prompts and outputs

### 5.2 Security

- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption for sensitive information

### 5.3 Reliability

- Regular backups of the database
- Error handling and logging

## 6. Future Enhancements
