# Natural Language Data Model Definition Prompt 2

Thank you for your help in defining some basic fields for the four core modules in this system.

To keep all this information together, I'll repeat the combined SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    prompt_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    output_id INTEGER REFERENCES outputs(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    conversation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE prompts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),  -- Nullable, allows for prompts that don't need a title
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    engineered BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,  -- Whether the prompt was manually engineered
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    conversation_ids INTEGER[],  -- Array of conversation IDs related to this prompt
    output_ids INTEGER[]  -- Array of output IDs generated from this prompt
);

CREATE TABLE outputs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),  -- Nullable, allows for outputs that don't need a title
    output TEXT NOT NULL,
    output_edited TEXT,  -- Nullable, in case the output is edited
    notes TEXT,  -- Additional notes about the output
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    conversation_ids INTEGER[],  -- Array of conversation IDs related to this output
    prompt_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL  -- Foreign key to the prompt that generated this output
);

CREATE TABLE agents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- The name of the GPT/LLM
    description TEXT,  -- A description of the GPT/LLM or its purpose
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    conversation_ids INTEGER[]  -- Array of conversation IDs related to this agent
);
```

## Additional Tables

I'd like to try to add back some of the data that was part of my original model but without adding back too much of the complication (if possible).

For the purpose of distinguishing between these essential parts of the database and less key parts, let's refer to the first four tables as the core modules.

Those are:

- Conversations (conversations)
- Prompts (prompts)
- Outputs (outputs)
- Agents (agents)

If I refer to the "core modules" - this is what I'm referring to.

Do you think it makes sense to add `core_` to each table name to make them easy to distinguish? If so, please make that change.

I'll describe the additional lookup tables in my database design and will also describe their purpose. Feel free to extract some of that information into table comments.

Where possible, I will define both the fields in my design and their database. If I neglect to include any details, make educated guesses.

## Notes

The main purpose of the conversations table is to hold the outputs, prompts, and agents together in a cohesive data relationship. While relationships are configured between each of these units and conversations, most relationships with lookups are to the other three elements.

# The Main Lookup Tables: Tags and Categories

## Tags Lookup

### Table Name
**`lookup_tags`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `tagname` (varchar)
- `tagdesc` (text)
- `createdat` (timestamp)

### Table Description

This table is a list of tags.

### Data Relationships

Every core module can be associated with an unlimited number of tags, so there are four many-to-many relationships here. 

The related values should be nullableâ€”users should be able to skip the tag assignment.

---

## Categories Lookup

### Table Name
**`lookup_cats`**

### Table Fields

- `id` (serial)
- `cat_name` (varchar)
- `cat_desc` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

### Table Description

As the name suggests, this is a category lookup table. Again, there should be many-to-many relationships between this table and the four core modules.

### Data Relationships

### Constraints

Values on tables related to the categories table should NOT be nullable. For every module, users should be required to assign at least one category.

---

# Secondary Lookup Tables

In addition to that, I had quite a long list of secondary lookup tables.

## Access UI Lookup

### Table Name
**`lookup_accessui`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `uiname` (varchar)

### Table Description

This is a lookup table with access UIs. Each of the four core modules can only be associated with one value in this lookup.

### Data Relationships

### Constraints

The related values should be nullable.

---

## Accuracy Level Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_accuracy_level`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `level_name` (varchar)
- `desc` (text)

### Table Description

This lookup is intended to allow the user to gauge the accuracy of generations from LLMs in order to flag suspect generations for closer examination.

### Data Relationships

There is a one to many (02M) relationship between this table and those tables related to it (each agent or output could be tagged with one level, but each accuracy level could be associated with many values on the corresponding tables).

### Constraints

The related values should be nullable. Users should be able to skip assigning an accuracy level.

---

## Actionability Level Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_actionability`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `levelname` (varchar)
- `level_desc` (text)

### Table Description

This lookup table lists levels of "actionability." It's used to triage prompt outputs for internal review by flagging those that are more actionable.

### Data Relationships

This table holds a one to many (02M) relationship with the outputs table.

Each output can only have one level of actionability, but each level of actionability can be associated with many outputs.

### Constraints

The related values should be nullable. Users should be able to skip assigning an actionability level.

---

## Activity Status Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_activitystatus`**

### Table Fields

- `id` (serial)
- `statusname` (varchar)
- `status_desc` (text)

### Table Description

This is a lookup table that lists activity levels. It's intended to distinguish between active entities and those that have been removed from production.

### Data Relationships

This status can apply to agents and prompts. In both cases, it's a one-to-many (O2M) relationship (each agent or prompt can only have one activity status, but each status can be associated with many values in the corresponding tables).

### Constraints

The related values should not be nullable. If there is a relationship between a module and "activity status," a value should be required.

---

## Agent Groups Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_agentgroups`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `groupname` (varchar)
- `groupdesc` (text)

### Table Description

This is a lookup table that is intended to divide agents into groups (for filtering, access restrictions, or to group common agents together for other reasons).

### Data Relationships

This lookup table has a many-to-many relationship with agents. Each agent can be in multiple groups and vice versa.

### Constraints

The related values should be nullable. Users should not assign an agent to a group.

---

## Automation Level Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_automationlevel`**

### Table Fields

- `id` (serial)
- `levelname` (varchar)
- `desc` (text)

### Table Description

This lookup table stores various levels of automation, but those are not mutually exclusive.

### Data Relationships

It relates to the agents table. There is a many-to-many relationship between this lookup and agents.

### Constraints

Related values should be nullable. Users can choose to skip assigning an automation level to an agent.

---

## Creation Account Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_creationaccount`**

### Table Fields

- `id`
- `accountname` (varchar)
- `accountemail` (varchar)
- `notes` (text)

### Table Description

This is a lookup table used to note which account a specific agent (or prompt or output) was generated with, intended for users who have multiple accounts with various LLM providers.

### Data Relationships

This table has a one-to-many (02M) relationship with all four core modules (agents, conversations, outputs, prompts). 

Each of these entities can be associated with one account, but each account can be associated with multiple entities within each of the core modules.

### Constraints

If related values exist, they should not be nullable. Users are required to specify which account an entity was created under.

---

## Output Libraries Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_outputlibraries`**

### Table Description

This is a lookup table that is intended to allow the user to control access to outputs they log by assigning them to a specific library (and in turn, access permissions can be configured for users against that library).

### Data Relationships

There is a many-to-many relationship between this table and the outputs table: each output can be associated with many libraries, and each library can store many associated outputs.

### Constraints

Related fields should be nullable. Users should be able to choose to skip assigning outputs to libraries.

---

## Data Retention Plan Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_dataretentionplan`**

### Table Description

This is a lookup table that stores different data retention plans (for example, GDPR). This table is intended to allow the user to associate specific LLM-generated entities with common compliance requirements related to data storage.

### Data Relationships

Because there are many compliance requirements, and users may wish to configure their own ones, a many-to-many relationship exists between this table and all four of the core modules (agents, conversations, outputs, prompts).

### Constraints

This related value is nullable. Users should not be required to

 assign a data retention policy if none applies.

---

## Data Sensitivity Level Table (Lookup)

### Table Name
**`lookup_datasensitivity`**

### Table Fields

- `id` (serial)
- `sensitivitylevel` (varchar)
- `description` (text)

### Table Description

This lookup table is intended to facilitate internal compliance requirements and to allow business users to label sensitive data accordingly or mark data as suitable for public release.

### Data Relationships

This table has a one to many (O2M) relationship with all of my core modules. Each core module can be associated with only one of these levels, but each level can be associated with many values in the core modules.

### Constraints

The related fields are nullable. Users should be able to skip assigning the related value.

---

## Programming Language Lookup Table

### Table Name

lookup_programminglanguage

### Table Fields

id (serial)
language (varchar)
desc (text)

### Table Description

This lookup table lists common programming languages. It is useful because all four system modules may target specific or various programming languages (for example, an output may contain a snippet of Python).

### Data Relationships

A many to many relationship should be configured between this lookup table and the four core modules.

### Constraints

For fields with relationship to this table, this should be a nullable values. Users should never be required to specify a programming language.

---

## Data Size Classifiers (Lookup)

### Table Name

lookup_datasizes

### Table Fields

id (serial)
size (varchar)

### Data Relationships

To cater for the possibility that a single output could contain multiple artifacts (for instance code blocks in different languages) there is a many to many (M2M) relationship between outputs and this table.

### Constraints

The field in the outputs table holding the foreign key should not be nullable. Users should be required to assign an output to a form.

---

### Markdown Conversion Lookup 

### Table Name
