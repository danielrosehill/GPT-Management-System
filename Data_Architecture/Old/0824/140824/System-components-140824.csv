Title,Type,Description,Status,Data Fields,API Endpoints
Archive,Organisational,"For data conservation, module for moving old outputs and other entities into archive class storage",Planned,,
Custom GPT inventory,Core Module,Keeps an accurate and detailed record of current custom GPTs,Active,,
GPT Categories,Taxonomy,Category list used to organise custom GPT inventory logically,Active,,
GPT Fleets,Taxonomy,"The idea here was to organise custom GPTs into specific ""fleets"". Fleets might have inter-related jobs or be designed for use by a specific internal team.",Active,,
GPT Models List,Taxonomy,"This taxonomy is a list of GPT models that can be used for various modules (for example, in outputs to show which underlying model drove the output and in custom GPTs to associate specific custom GPTs with their underlying models)",Active,,
GPT Platforms List,Taxonomy,"Because I work with a few different systems, this taxonomy is useful to be able to associate outputs and GPTs with the platform I'm accessing them through (ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, etc)",Active,,
GPT tags,Taxonomy,Used for tagging both outputs and GPTs,Active,,
Output Formats,Taxonomy,"Because outputs can be generated in a variety of formats (plain text, markdown, rich text) I thought it was useful to have this as a taxonomy",Active,,
Output Language,Taxonomy,I frequently use ChatGPT for generating code snippets and full scripts. This taxonomy is a list of the 50 most popular programming languages. It allows me to quickly sort code-related prompt outputs according to the code that was generated. The two languages I use most commonly are Python and Bash,Active,,
Post Prompt Actions,Taxonomy,"This taxonomy provides a list of actions to be undertaken after a prompt has been run. A very common one that I use as a kind of first entry holder is ""to review"". But there are more detailed ones like ""request approval for recommendation"". This taxonomy is used with the prompt outputs module",Active,,
Project tags,Taxonomy,Used to create associations between GPT outputs and discrete projects,Active,,
Prompt library,Core Module,Library of prompts,Active,,
Prompt Objectives,Taxonomy,"I thought it would be helpful to have a taxonomy of prompting ""objectives."" Roughly, this is the object that the user had in mind when prompting. This taxonomy is useful because it allows for correlations to be made (after the prompt has been long forgotten about) between the output achieved and what the user was hoping for",Active,,
Prompt output library,Core Module,Library of prompt outputs,Active,,
Prompt Output Type,Taxonomy,"Prompt outputs can be categorised into the kind of information that they provided. Common ones I use are ""Technical evaluation list"", ""purchasing recommendations"", ""hardware compatibility advice"" etc",Active,,
