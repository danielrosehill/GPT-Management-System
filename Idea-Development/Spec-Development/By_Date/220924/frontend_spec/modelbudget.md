# Output Hub MVP Frontend Budget and Timeline

*Note: This document was generated using Claude, an AI assistant. While efforts have been made to provide realistic estimates, actual costs and timelines may vary based on specific project requirements, team composition, and unforeseen circumstances.*

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the estimated budget and timeline for developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) frontend for the Output Hub project. The MVP will focus on essential features to demonstrate the core value proposition of the product.

## 2. MVP Scope

The MVP frontend will include:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Dashboard with basic analytics
- Prompt creation and management
- Output viewing and basic search functionality
- Responsive design for web and mobile

- Week 2: UI/UX design and prototype creation

### Phase 2: Core Development (6 weeks)
- Week 3-4: Set up project structure, implement authentication
- Week 5-6: Develop dashboard and prompt management features
- Week 7-8: Implement output viewing and basic search functionality

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (2 weeks)
- Week 9: Internal testing and bug fixes
- Week 10: User acceptance testing and final refinements

Total timeline: 10 weeks

## 5. Key Milestones

1. Project Kickoff: Day 1 of Week 1
2. Design Approval: End of Week 2
3. Core Features Completion: End of Week 8
4. MVP Frontend Release: End of Week 10

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

### Assumptions:
- Backend API is available and well-documented
- No major changes in MVP requirements once development begins
- Team members are available full-time for the project duration

### Risks:
- Potential delays due to API integration challenges
- Scope creep could extend the timeline
- Unforeseen usability issues may require additional design iterations

## 7. Next Steps

1. Review and approve MVP scope, budget, and timeline
2. Assemble the frontend development team
3. Set up development environment and tools
4. Schedule kickoff meeting and begin Phase 1

This budget and timeline provide a framework for developing the Output Hub MVP frontend. Regular monitoring and adjustments may be necessary as the project progresses to ensure successful delivery within the specified constraints.
